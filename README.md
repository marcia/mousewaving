Q: If searching for a video on Khan Academy returned a bunch of thumbnails, how would it feel to scrub through the videos on mousemove?

A: Kind of cool, but slow.

Note: You have to run this on a webserver, since the Flash player complains/fails otherwise.

* [YouTube JS API Reference](http://code.google.com/apis/youtube/js_api_reference.html)

PS I imagined that it would be smoother and more delightful, but this doesn't mimic handwaving (hence mousewaving) at all!
